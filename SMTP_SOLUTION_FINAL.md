- 30-second timeout for reliability
```

### 2. **Dependencies** (`backend/requirements.txt`)
```python
# Removed unnecessary packages:

- requests (removed)
- aiohttp (removed)

# Kept essential:

```

### 3. **Configuration** (`backend/app/core/config.py`)
```python
# Simplified config:
- Removed SENDGRID_API_KEY
- Kept only SMTP settings
```

### 4. **Environment** (`backend/.env`)
```python
# Clean SMTP config only:
MAIL_USERNAME=gokul.ietvit@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD="hoac wfgv zmwa fcjh"
MAIL_FROM=gokul.ietvit@gmail.com
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
```
