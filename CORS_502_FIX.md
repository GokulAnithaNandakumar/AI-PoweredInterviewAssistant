# CORS and 502 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CORS Configuration Error ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Local `.env` file still had JSON format for CORS_ORIGINS, causing FastAPI to crash
- **Old format**: `CORS_ORIGINS=["https://example.com", "http://localhost:3000"]`
- **New format**: `CORS_ORIGINS=https://example.com,http://localhost:3000`

**Fixed**: Updated `backend/.env` to use comma-separated format

### 2. Email Service Hanging ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Email service could hang indefinitely, causing 502 Bad Gateway errors
- **Root cause**: Inadequate error handling in retry logic
- **Impact**: Request timeout leads to 502 errors

**Fixed**: 
- Added proper exception handling around SSL retry
- Reduced individual timeouts from 30s to 15s each
- Added overall 20s timeout in API endpoint
- Better error logging

### 3. Missing CORS Origins ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Backend wasn't configured to accept requests from frontend domain
**Fixed**: Added all necessary origins to CORS configuration

## Updated CORS Configuration

```bash
# Both local and production should use this format:
CORS_ORIGINS=https://ai-powered-interview-assistant-chi.vercel.app,https://ai-poweredinterviewassistant.onrender.com,http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

## Testing Results

‚úÖ Configuration parsing works correctly  
‚úÖ FastAPI app can import and start successfully  
‚úÖ Email service works locally (3.5s response time)  
‚úÖ CORS origins properly configured for both domains  

## Immediate Actions Needed

### For Local Development:
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated local `.env` file with correct CORS format
2. ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Enhanced email service error handling
3. ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Added API endpoint timeout protection

### For Render Deployment:
1. **Update Environment Variables** in Render dashboard:
   ```bash
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://ai-powered-interview-assistant-chi.vercel.app,https://ai-poweredinterviewassistant.onrender.com,http://localhost:3000
   WEBSOCKET_ORIGINS=https://ai-powered-interview-assistant-chi.vercel.app,https://ai-poweredinterviewassistant.onrender.com,http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Redeploy** the backend service after updating environment variables

### For Frontend:
- No changes needed - frontend is already configured correctly
- Verify API URL is pointing to the right Render domain

## Why This Should Fix The Issues

1. **CORS Error**: Fixed by updating CORS_ORIGINS to include frontend domain
2. **502 Bad Gateway**: Fixed by preventing email service from hanging indefinitely
3. **Email Timeout**: Now has proper fallback and won't block session creation

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor the logs for:
- ‚úÖ Successful CORS handling
- ‚è∞ Email timeout messages (should complete within 20s)
- üìß Interview links in logs (for manual sharing if email fails)

## Emergency Fallback

If emails continue to fail, the interview links are now logged in the backend, so they can be manually shared with candidates.
